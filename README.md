# Elastic-SIEM-Lab
## Description
In this lab, Iâ€™ll be walking through steps on how to set up a home lab for Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using the Elastic Web Portal and a Kali Linux VM. 
That way we can learn how to generate security events on the Kali VM, set up an agent to forward data to the SIEM, query and analyze the logs in the SIEM.
## Utilities Used
1. VirtualBox or VMware
2. Kali Linux (basic knowledge needed.)
3. Elastic SIEM
